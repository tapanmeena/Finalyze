   * Enable notifications or reminders when a recurring expense is due.

2. **Expense Suggestions**:

   * Use machine learning or rule-based logic to suggest categories based on past behavior. Example: if a user frequently logs "Coffee" under a certain amount, the app will auto-suggest the "Coffee" category for future similar entries.

---

#### **Milestones for Phase 2**:

* **Week 9-10**: Implement recurring expenses and notifications.
* **Week 11-12**: Develop expense suggestion algorithm;
